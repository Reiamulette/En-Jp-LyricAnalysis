Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying

Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining

That you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

That love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing

That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living
See rock shows near New York City
Get tickets as low as $70

Got to Get You into My Life

Or play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning

Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning
